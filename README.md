# Remote Desktop Setup Script

Automated setup script that installs and configures XFCE desktop environment with xRDP server on Linux systems, including performance optimizations, network tuning, and security configurations. It inludes Firefox, Chromium, VS Code, Windsurf. It can be configured easily Microsoft RDP.

   - Verify xRDP service is running: `systemctl status xrdp`
   - Check firewall settings: `sudo ufw status`
   - Ensure port 3389 is accessible
